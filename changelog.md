## Version 4
- Added the changelog
- Added the `<nofludd>` area tag (requested by Flunkass)
- Added the `<resetswitch>` area tag (requested by GreenSlayder_x)
- Added invisible signs (requested by Rai)
- Anti-Pause can no longer be triggered in Story Mode
- Replaced giant enemy tags with customizable enemy tags
- Replaced \<eartharea\> and \<spacearea\> with `<gravity:x>`
- Added customizable water colors
- The gap to the left of `<waterarea>`'s water has been removed
- `<waterarea>`'s water can now be customized, and water signs can now be made to set the water level to a specific value instead of the sign's y position
- `<firearea>`'s fireballs can now be customized
- `<airarea>`'s wind can now be customized
- Removed the Elemental Silver Stars-specific tags (debug, Aether door, etc.)
- Renamed "Area Attributes" to just "Area Tags". It's not a change in the mod itself, but I like the new name better.
